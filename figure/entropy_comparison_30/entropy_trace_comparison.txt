Let me brainstorm some artists: 

-{{{picked token: ' Ste' | entropy: 2.6135 | entropy@temp: 4.9862 | delta: 2.3726 | temp: 1.3906 | top5: ' Ste' (0.2872), ' The' (0.1974), ' **' (0.1742), ' Lyn' (0.0641), ' Tom' (0.0414)}}} Stevie Ray Vaughan is a big name from Texas. He had albums like "Texas Flood" and "Live at the{{{picked token: ' Star' | entropy: 4.7898 | entropy@temp: 0.4126 | delta: 4.3772 | temp: 0.2021 | top5: ' House' (0.1910), ' Star' (0.1233), ' Apollo' (0.0848), ' Wh' (0.0426), ' Fill' (0.0214)}}} Star-Club." But "Texas" is a word I can't repeat, so I'll have to be creative with the titles.

-{{{picked token: ' The' | entropy: 2.2505 | entropy@temp: 4.7586 | delta: 2.5081 | temp: 1.3047 | top5: ' The' (0.6078), ' Lyn' (0.0876), ' Out' (0.0221), ' Pan' (0.0184), ' Bob' (0.0172)}}} The Rolling Stones? No, they're not particularly Texas-associated. 

- Maybe artists like Gram Parsons? He was from Oklahoma but had ties to Texas through his work. Not sure. 
...
- The Marshall Tucker Band: They're from Georgia, not Texas. 

- Texas itself has bands like The Wild{{{picked token: 'he' | entropy: 3.5262 | entropy@temp: 0.1280 | delta: 3.3981 | temp: 0.4316 | top5: 'he' (0.4545), ' T' (0.0510), ',' (0.0510), 'flowers' (0.0329), ' West' (0.0309)}}}hearts? No, that's not classic rock.

Classic rock artists from Texas:
...
- Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble

- Kim{{{picked token: ' Wilson' | entropy: 2.2693 | entropy@temp: 0.0000 | delta: 2.2693 | temp: 0.0281 | top5: ' Carn' (0.4987), ' Wilson' (0.1619), ' Deal' (0.0596), ' R' (0.0526), 'bra' (0.0436)}}} Wilson (from Texas, but not sure about albums)

- The T{{{picked token: 'umble' | entropy: 2.8772 | entropy@temp: 0.4892 | delta: 2.3880 | temp: 0.2168 | top5: '-B' (0.3003), 'urtles' (0.1939), 'ornado' (0.1419), 'umble' (0.0759), 'orn' (0.0522)}}}umbleweeds? Not a band.

I recall that the band "{{{picked token: 'The' | entropy: 1.1497 | entropy@temp: 3.6768 | delta: 2.5271 | temp: 1.3984 | top5: 'The' (0.7863), 'Texas' (0.0939), 'R' (0.0144), 'P' (0.0099), 'L' (0.0077)}}}The Black Keys" is from Texas, but they're more modern indie rock. Classic rock might be earlier.

Classic rock typically refers to the era from the late 1960s to the 1980s.
...
Let's think of bands with Texas roots:

-{{{picked token: ' The' | entropy: 3.4242 | entropy@temp: 5.7771 | delta: 2.3529 | temp: 1.2969 | top5: ' The' (0.4478), ' Lyn' (0.0828), ' Ste' (0.0253), ' Gary' (0.0223), ' Bob' (0.0174)}}} The Marshall Tucker Band: They have a Texas connection? Marshall Tucker was born in Texas, I think. Yes, he was from Texas.

- The Doobie Brothers: They're from California, but have a Texas connection? Not really.

-{{{picked token: ' Lyn' | entropy: 3.4200 | entropy@temp: 6.1648 | delta: 2.7448 | temp: 1.3750 | top5: ' Lyn' (0.4444), ' Ste' (0.0388), ' Gary' (0.0302), ' Tom' (0.0251), ' Gram' (0.0195)}}} Lynyrd Skynyrd: They're from Georgia, but had a lot of Texas influence? They played in Texas, but not born there.

I found online that Lynyrd Skynyrd is associated with the South, but specifically, they're from Georgia. However, they had a famous album "Lynyrd Skynyrd" but that's not unique.
...
2. Stevie Ray Vaughan - "Live at the Star-Club" (no "Texas")

3. The Marshall Tucker Band - "{{{picked token: 'The' | entropy: 3.9784 | entropy@temp: 6.7493 | delta: 2.7710 | temp: 1.4219 | top5: 'The' (0.2734), 'South' (0.0834), 'Let' (0.0736), 'Deep' (0.0649), 'Green' (0.0348)}}}The Marshall Tucker Band" (but that's not an album title; their albums have titles)

Marshall Tucker Band albums: "{{{picked token: 'The' | entropy: 2.4800 | entropy@temp: 5.1885 | delta: 2.7084 | temp: 1.3516 | top5: 'The' (0.6160), 'Deep' (0.0573), 'Let' (0.0239), 'South' (0.0224), 'T' (0.0164)}}}The Marshall Tucker Band" (self-titled), "The{{{picked token: ' Marshall' | entropy: 5.6409 | entropy@temp: 2.9405 | delta: 2.7003 | temp: 0.7266 | top5: ' Marshall' (0.1827), ' Way' (0.0462), ' Best' (0.0338), ' Road' (0.0263), ' Thr' (0.0193)}}} Marshall Tucker Band" is the band name, but their albums include "The{{{picked token: ' Marshall' | entropy: 2.5409 | entropy@temp: 0.0928 | delta: 2.4481 | temp: 0.6133 | top5: ' Marshall' (0.6980), ' Best' (0.0154), ' Way' (0.0100), ' Road' (0.0088), ' Texas' (0.0088)}}} Marshall Tucker Band" as a title? I think they have "The Marshall Tucker Band" as a compilation or something.

Better to pick specific album titles.
...
- Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble: "Texas Flood", "Live at the Star-Club", "Stevie Ray Vaughan"

- The T{{{picked token: 'ornado' | entropy: 2.7461 | entropy@temp: 0.5208 | delta: 2.2254 | temp: 0.2734 | top5: '-B' (0.3229), 'ornado' (0.1433), 'umble' (0.1433), 'urtles' (0.1346), 'orn' (0.0437)}}}ornadoes? Not Texas.

I recall that the band "The{{{picked token: ' Box' | entropy: 4.7495 | entropy@temp: 2.0682 | delta: 2.6814 | temp: 0.6602 | top5: ' Texas' (0.2232), ' Mavericks' (0.0498), ' Black' (0.0498), ' Lone' (0.0413), ' K' (0.0267)}}} Box Tops" is from Tennessee, not Texas.

Perhaps I can use:
...
- The Tornadoes (not sure)

- The{{{picked token: ' Black' | entropy: 3.9862 | entropy@temp: 1.3304 | delta: 2.6558 | temp: 0.6445 | top5: ' Black' (0.3220), ' Texas' (0.0982), ' Eagles' (0.0560), ' Lone' (0.0300), ' Wild' (0.0206)}}} Black Keys (but they're more modern)

For classic rock, let's go with:
...
- The Tornadoes: Not Texas.

- The{{{picked token: ' Black' | entropy: 4.0141 | entropy@temp: 1.6851 | delta: 2.3290 | temp: 0.6875 | top5: ' Black' (0.3120), ' Box' (0.0741), ' Texas' (0.0577), ' Band' (0.0422), ' Do' (0.0350)}}} Black Keys: Born in Texas, but they're more indie rock.

For classic rock, I'll go with:
...
Another artist: The Grateful Dead – they have a Texas connection? Not really.

I found that the band "The{{{picked token: ' Texas' | entropy: 5.0735 | entropy@temp: 2.4415 | delta: 2.6320 | temp: 0.6484 | top5: ' Texas' (0.1754), ' Lone' (0.0417), ' Band' (0.0417), ' Mavericks' (0.0286), ' K' (0.0253)}}} Texas Tornadoes" but not classic rock.

Let's think of the Texas music scene.
...
- "Wilson" (Kim Wilson) – but not an album title

Kim Wilson has albums like "The T{{{picked token: 'ornado' | entropy: 3.4085 | entropy@temp: 0.7538 | delta: 2.6548 | temp: 0.5781 | top5: 'ornado' (0.3977), 'umble' (0.0945), 'enth' (0.0288), 'unes' (0.0288), 'ies' (0.0254)}}}ornadoes", but not sure.

The Tornadoes is a band from Texas? Not really.
...
Let's look for real album titles.

I recall that the band "The{{{picked token: ' Black' | entropy: 3.4995 | entropy@temp: 1.2518 | delta: 2.2478 | temp: 0.6797 | top5: ' Black' (0.3849), ' Texas' (0.1250), ' Out' (0.0521), ' Fab' (0.0279), ' Band' (0.0246)}}} Black Keys" has an album called "Brothers", but they're not classic rock.
