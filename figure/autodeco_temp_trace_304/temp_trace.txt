This is a complex or challenging question, and it is difficult to provide a direct and correct answer. I need to think about it.
Well, so the problem says: If n is an integer, and the unit and tens digits of n² are u and 7, respectively, find u. Hmm, okay, so we need to figure out what the units digit of a square can be, but also the tens digit is 7. Wait, maybe I should recall that when squaring numbers, the last two digits of the square depend only on the last two digits of the original number, right? Because (10a + b)² = 100a² + 20ab + b², so the last two digits come from 20ab + b². So maybe I can let n be a number ending with some digit, say d, so n = 10k + d where d is 0-9, and then compute n² mod 100 to see what the tens and units digits are.

Let's try that. Let n = 10k + d, d ∈ {0,1,2,...,9}. Then n² = 100k² + 20kd + d². So modulo 100, that's (20kd + d²) mod 100. Let's denote the units digit as u, tens digit as 7, so when we write n² as ...t7u? Wait, no, wait: unit digit is u, tens digit is 7. Wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says: "the unit and tens digits of n² are u and 7, respectively". So unit digit is u, tens digit is 7. So for example, if n² was 17, unit digit 7, tens digit 1, but here tens digit is 7, unit digit is u. Wait, no: tens digit is the second from the right, unit is the rightmost. So yes, n² = ...a7u? Wait, no, wait: no, digits: rightmost is units (10��), next is tens (10¹), so for a number like 123, units=3, tens=2, hundreds=1. So yes, tens digit is 7, unit digit is u. So n² �� 10*7 + u mod 100, so n² �� 70 + u mod 100, where u is a digit (0-9), so n² mod 100 is between 70 and 79 inclusive? Wait, is that right? Wait, 70 + u, u is digit 0-9, so 70 to 79. But hold on, maybe not necessarily? Wait, no, tens digit is 7, so the number is ...7u, so yes, last two digits are 7 (tens) and u (units), so last two digits form a number from 70 to 79. So we need to find all squares mod 100 that end with a tens digit of 7 (i.e., 70-79), then the units digit of those squares is u, which should be unique? The problem says "determine the value of u", so it must be unique.

Okay, so let's list all squares mod 100 for digits d=0 to 9, since as we saw, the last two digits only depend on last digit d of n. Wait, is that true? Wait, when we did n=10k + d, n²=100k² +20kd + d², so the last two digits depend on 20kd + d², so actually, even though d is the last digit, the tens digit of n² depends on both d and k? Wait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here. If n ends with d, then n = 10k + d, but k can be any integer, so actually, the tens digit of n² depends on d and the tens digit of n? Wait, no, wait, no—wait, no, actually, when considering the last two digits of n², it's equivalent to n mod 100, because (n + 100)² = n² + 200n + 10000, so last two digits same as n². Therefore, to find all possible last two digits of squares, we can just compute m² mod 100 for m=0 to 99, but maybe we can do it smarter by noting that if m = 10a + b, then m² = 100a² + 20ab + b², so last two digits are (20ab + b²) mod 100. So here, b is the units digit of m, a is the tens digit of m (mod 10, since 20ab mod 100 depends on a mod 5? Wait, maybe better to fix the units digit of m first, since the units digit of m² is determined solely by the units digit of m, and the tens digit of m² depends on the units digit of m and the tens digit of m? Wait, let's try fixing the units digit of n, say d = 0,1,...,9, then for each d, what can the tens digit of n² be?

Let's make a table for d from 0 to 9:

d=0: n ends with 0, so n² ends with 00, so tens digit 0, units digit 0 → not 7 tens.

d=1: n ends with 1, n² ends with 1, so units digit 1, tens digit? Let's take examples: 1²=1 (01), 11²=121 (21), 21²=441 (41), 31²=961 (61), 41²=1681 (81), 51²=2601 (01), 61²=3721 (21), 71²=5041 (41), 81²=6561 (61), 91²=8281 (81). So tens digits cycle through 0,2,4,6,8,0,2,... for d=1. Never 7.

d=2: n ends with 2: 2²=4 (04), 12²=144 (44), 22²=484 (84), 32²=1024 (24), 42²=1764 (64), 52²=2704 (04), 62²=3844 (44), 72²=5184 (84), 82²=6724 (24), 92²=8464 (64). Tens digits: 0,4,8,2,6,0,4,8,2,6. Never 7.

d=3: n ends with 3: 3²=9 (09), 13²=169 (69), 23²=529 (29), 33²=1089 (89), 43²=1849 (49), 53²=2809 (09), 63²=3969 (69), 73²=5329 (29), 83²=6889 (89), 93²=8649 (49). Tens digits: 0,6,2,8,4,0,6,2,8,4. No 7s.

d=4: n ends with 4: 4²=16 (16), 14²=196 (96), 24²=576 (76), 34²=1156 (56), 44²=1936 (36), 54²=2916 (16), 64²=4096 (96), 74²=5476 (76), 84²=7056 (56), 94²=8836 (36). Wait a second! Here we go: 24²=576, so last two digits 76; 74²=5476, last two digits 76. Oh, so tens digit is 7 here! And units digit is 6. Wait, so for d=4 (n ends with 4), n² can have tens digit 7? Let's check the tens digits in the list: 16 (tens=1), 96 (tens=9), 76 (tens=7), 56 (tens=5), 36 (tens=3), 16 (tens=1), 96 (tens=9), 76 (tens=7), 56 (tens=5), 36 (tens=3). Yes, so when n ends with 4 or 6? Wait, hold on, d=6 is the other digit that squares to 6 mod 10 (since 4²=16, 6²=36). Let's check d=6 to be thorough.

d=5: n ends with 5: 5²=25 (25), 15²=225 (25), 25²=625 (25), always ends with 25, so tens digit 2, units 5. Not 7.

d=6: n ends with 6: 6²=36 (36), 16²=256 (56), 26²=676 (76), 36²=1296 (96), 46²=2116 (16), 56²=3136 (36), 66²=4356 (56), 76²=5776 (76), 86²=7396 (96), 96²=9216 (16). Wait, tens digits here: 3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1. Oh! So 26²=676 (tens=7, units=6), 76²=5776 (tens=7, units=6). So here too, tens digit 7, units digit 6.

d=7: n ends with 7: 7²=49 (49), 17²=289 (89), 27²=729 (29), 37²=1369 (69), 47²=2209 (09), 57²=3249 (49), 67²=4489 (89), 77²=5929 (29), 87²=7569 (69), 97²=9409 (09). Tens digits: 4,8,2,6,0,4,8,2,6,0. No 7s.

d=8: n ends with 8: 8²=64 (64), 18²=324 (24), 28²=784 (84), 38²=1444 (44), 48²=2304 (04), 58²=3364 (64), 68²=4624 (24), 78²=6084 (84), 88²=7744 (44), 98²=9604 (04). Tens digits: 6,2,8,4,0,6,2,8,4,0. No 7s.

d=9: n ends with 9: 9²=81 (81), 19²=361 (61), 29²=841 (41), 39²=1521 (21), 49²=2401 (01), 59²=3481 (81), 69²=4761 (61), 79²=6241 (41), 89²=7921 (21), 99²=9801 (01). Tens digits: 8,6,4,2,0,8,6,4,2,0. No 7s.

Wait, so let's recap the cases where we had tens digit 7 for n²:

- d=4 (n ends with 4): looked at n=24,74,... n=24²=576 (last two digits 76), n=74²=5476 (76), so yes, tens digit 7, units digit 6.

- d=6 (n ends with 6): n=26²=676 (76), n=76²=5776 (76), same thing: tens digit 7, units digit 6.

Wait, so in both cases, when the tens digit of n² is 7, the units digit u is 6? Let's check if there are any other possibilities. Did we miss any d? We did d=0 to 9, and only d=4 and d=6 gave us squares with tens digit 7, and in both cases, the units digit of the square was 6.

Wait, let's test another number to be sure. Take n=14: 14²=196, last two digits 96 (tens=9, units=6). n=24²=576 (tens=7, units=6). n=34²=1156 (56), n=44²=1936 (36), n=54²=2916 (16), n=64²=4096 (96), n=74²=5476 (76), n=84²=7056 (56), n=94²=8836 (36). Yep, so for n ending with 4, squares end with 16,36,56,76,96 in the tens place? Wait, no, for n=10k+4, n²=100k² + 80k + 16, so last two digits are (80k + 16) mod 100. So 80k mod 100: let's see, k=0: 16, k=1: 96, k=2: 176→76, k=3: 256→56, k=4: 336→36, k=5: 416→16, so yes, cycles every 5: 16,96,76,56,36. So when k≡2 mod 5, last two digits 76 (tens=7, units=6); k≡7 mod 5? Wait, k=2: 2 mod 5=2, k=7: 7 mod 5=2, so yes, k=2,7,12,... give 76.

Similarly, n=10k+6: n²=100k² + 120k + 36=100k² + 100k + 20k + 36=100(k² + k) + 20k + 36, so last two digits (20k + 36) mod 100. Let's compute for k=0:36, k=1:56, k=2:76, k=3:96, k=4:116→16, k=5:136→36, so cycles: 36,56,76,96,16. So here, k=2,7,... give 76 as well (k=2: 20*2+36=76, yes).

So in both cases, when the last two digits of n² are 76, which is the only two-digit number with tens digit 7 (since tens=7, units=u, so 70-79) that is a perfect square? Wait, is 70-79 any other squares? Let's check all numbers from 0 to 99 squared mod 100, but maybe we can check if there's a square between 70 and 79.

Squares mod 100: let's list all possible squares mod 100 by last two digits. Wait, maybe faster to check numbers whose squares end with 7 in the tens place. Wait, but we already did by last digit of n.

Wait, another way: suppose n² �� 10*7 + u mod 100, so n² �� 70 + u mod 100, u ∈ {0,1,...,9}. So we need to solve n² �� c mod 100 where c is 70-79, and see for which c there exists a solution, and what u is.

Let's check c=70: is 70 a quadratic residue mod 4? 70 mod 4=2, but squares mod 4 are 0 or 1, so no.

c=71: 71 mod 4=3, squares mod 4 can't be 3, so no.

c=72: 72 mod 4=0, okay, squares mod 4=0 when n even. But let's check mod 25 too? Maybe overcomplicating. Wait, we already saw from examples that only 76 is a square mod 100 with tens digit 7. Wait, let's check n=24: 24²=576, n=26:676, n=74:5476, n=76:5776, so last two digits 76 in both cases. Is there any other number? Let's try n=124: 124²=15376, last two 76. n=126:126²=15876, last two 76. n=174:174²=30276, last two 76. n=176:176²=30976, last two 76. So seems consistent.

Wait, let's check if there's a square ending with 7 in the tens place and different units digit. For example, is there a square like x70? Let's see, squares ending with 0 must be multiples of 10, so n=10m, n²=100m², ends with 00, so can't be 70. x71? Squares ending with 1 are numbers ending with 1 or 9, as we saw (1²=1, 9²=81, 11²=121, 19²=361, etc.), so last two digits of squares ending with 1: from d=1 and d=9 cases, we saw tens digits were 0,2,4,6,8,0,... and 0,8,6,4,2,... so never 7. x72? Squares ending with 2: but squares never end with 2,4,5,6,8? Wait no, squares end with 0,1,4,5,6,9. Wait, hold on! Units digits of squares can only be 0,1,4,5,6,9. That's a key point I forgot earlier! So the units digit u of n² must be one of 0,1,4,5,6,9. So that immediately rules out u=2,3,7,8.

Wait, the problem says unit digit is u, tens digit is 7. So since u must be a possible units digit of a square, u ∈ {0,1,4,5,6,9}. So we can narrow down to these. Now, we already saw in the cases where tens digit is 7, u=6, which is in that set. Let's see if any other u in {0,1,4,5,6,9} can have tens digit 7.

Check u=0: squares ending with 0 must end with 00, so tens digit 0, not 7.

u=1: squares ending with 1: as above, tens digits cycle through 0,2,4,6,8, etc., never 7.

u=4: squares ending with 4: numbers ending with 2 or 8 (2²=4, 8²=64). Let's check their squares' tens digits: n=12²=144 (tens=4), 22²=484 (8), 32²=1024 (2), 42²=1764 (6), 52²=2704 (0), 62²=3844 (4), so tens digits 4,8,2,6,0,4,... so never 7.

u=5: squares ending with 5: numbers ending with 5, squares end with 25, so tens digit 2, not 7.

u=6: squares ending with 6: numbers ending with 4 or 6 (4²=16, 6²=36). As we checked earlier, for n ending with 4: squares end with 16,36,56,76,96 (tens digits 1,3,5,7,9), and for n ending with 6: squares end with 36,56,76,96,16 (tens digits 3,5,7,9,1). So here, when tens digit is 7, the units digit is 6. Perfect, that's exactly what we need.

u=9: squares ending with 9: numbers ending with 3 or 7 (3²=9, 7²=49). Check tens digits: n=13²=169 (6), 23²=529 (2), 33²=1089 (8), 43²=1849 (4), 53²=2809 (0), so tens digits 6,2,8,4,0,... cycle through even digits, never 7 (since 7 is odd, and all these tens digits are even? Wait, 6,2,8,4,0 are all even, so yes, squares ending with 9 have even tens digits, so can't have tens digit 7 (which is odd). That's another way to see it: if a square ends with 9, its tens digit is even? Let's check: 13²=169 (tens=6, even), 23²=529 (2, even), 33²=1089 (8, even), 43²=1849 (4, even), 53²=2809 (0, even), 63²=3969 (6, even), yes, so always even tens digit for squares ending with 9, so can't be 7.

So summarizing with the units digit constraint:

- u must be 0,1,4,5,6,9 (only possible units digits for squares)

- u=0: tens digit 0 (from squares ending with 00) → no

- u=1: tens digits even (from earlier examples) → can't be 7 (odd)

- u=4: tens digits even (from n=12,22,... squares have even tens digits: 4,8,2,6,0) → 7 is odd, so no

- u=5: tens digit always 2 (squares ending with 5 end with 25) → no

- u=6: tens digits can be odd (1,3,5,7,9 as seen), specifically when tens digit=7, units digit=6

- u=9: tens digits even (as established) → can't be 7 (odd)

Therefore, the only possible u is 6.

Wait, just to make 100% sure, let's check if there's any square with tens digit 7 and units digit something else, but we know units digit must be in that set, and we ruled out all others. Let's try to see if 70-79 has any squares:

70: not a square, and as we saw mod 4, 70≡2 mod 4, squares can't be 2 mod 4.

71: 71≡3 mod 4, squares can't be 3 mod 4.

72: 72≡0 mod 4, possible? Let's check mod 8: squares mod 8 are 0,1,4. 72 mod 8=0, so possible. But do any squares end with 72? Let's see, numbers ending with 4 or 6: n=14²=196, 24²=576, 34²=1156, 44²=1936, 54²=2916, 64²=4096, 74²=5476, 84²=7056, 94²=8836 → last two digits 96,76,56,36,16,96,76,56,36 for n ending with 4. For n ending with 6: 16²=256,26²=676,36²=1296,46²=2116,56²=3136,66²=4356,76²=5776,86²=7396,96²=9216 → last two digits 56,76,96,16,36,56,76,96,16. So no square ends with 72,73,...79 except 76. Let's check 75: squares ending with 5 end with 25, so no. 74: units digit 4, squares ending with 4 have last two digits like 16,36,56,76,96 as above, so no 74. 77: units digit 7, but squares never end with 7, so no. 78: units digit 8, squares never end with 8, so no. 79: units digit 9, squares ending with 9 have even tens digits, as we saw (6,2,8,4,0), so 79 is odd tens digit, impossible.

So the only possible number in 70-79 that's a perfect square (mod 100) is 76. Therefore, the tens digit is 7 (given), units digit is 6, so u=6.

I think that's solid. We did multiple approaches: listing examples, checking units digit constraints, modular arithmetic for squares, and each time it points to u=6. The key was remembering that units digits of squares are restricted, which narrowed down the possibilities, and then checking which of those could have tens digit 7, which only 6 works.

I don't see any gaps here. Initially, I was worried maybe I missed a case, but going through d=0 to 9 carefully and cross-checking with the units digit rules helped confirm. So the answer should be 6.
</think>

To determine the value of $ u $, where the **unit digit** of $ n^2 $ is $ u $ and the **tens digit** is 7, we analyze the possible last two digits of perfect squares.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of Squares Modulo 100

For any integer $ n $, the last two digits of $ n^2 $ depend only on $ n \mod 100 $. Therefore, it suffices to consider all values $ n = 0 $ to $ 99 $, compute $ n^2 \mod 100 $, and observe which results have **tens digit = 7**.

However, a more efficient method is to note that for a number $ n $ with unit digit $ d $ (i.e., $ n = 10k + d $), the square $ n^2 $ has a known pattern in its last two digits based on $ d $. We can systematically check each possible unit digit $ d \in \{0,1,\dots,9\} $.

---

### Step 2: Check All Possible Unit Digits

Let’s examine the last two digits of $ n^2 $ when $ n $ ends in each digit from 0 to 9:

| Unit Digit $ d $ | Example $ n $ | $ n^2 $ | Last Two Digits |
|--------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| 0                   | 10               | 100        | 00                |
| 1                   | 11               | 121        | 21                |
| 2                   | 12               | 144        | 44                |
| 3                   | 13               | 169        | 69                |
| 4                   | 24               | 576        | **76**            |
| 5                   | 15               | 225        | 25                |
| 6                   | 26               | 676        | **76**            |
| 7                   | 17               | 289        | 89                |
| 8                   | 18               | 324        | 24                |
| 9                   | 19               | 361        | 61                |

From this table, we see that **only** numbers ending in **4 or 6** produce squares with **last two digits 76**, i.e., **tens digit = 7** and **unit digit = 6**.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Uniqueness of $ u $

The problem states that the **unit digit** is $ u $, and the **tens digit** is 7. From the above, the only such square that satisfies this condition is **76**, so the **unit digit $ u $** must be **6**.

Also, recall that **perfect squares cannot end in digits other than 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9**. This further confirms that **no other value for $ u $** is possible.

- For example:
  - If $ u = 0 $, then $ n^2 $ ends in 00 → tens digit = 0 ��
  - If $ u = 1 $, tens digit is always even (e.g., 21, 41, etc.) ��
  - If $ u = 4 $, tens digit is even (e.g., 16, 36, etc.) ��
  - If $ u = 5 $, $ n^2 $ ends in 25 → tens digit = 2 ��
  - If $ u = 9 $, tens digit is even (e.g., 69, 89, etc.) ��

Only when $ u = 6 $ do we get a square with **tens digit = 7**.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{6}
$$

P.S. The only possible unit digit $ u $ such that the tens digit of $ n^2 $ is 7 is 6.<|im_end|>
