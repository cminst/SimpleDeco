The points $(3, 5), (9, 11)$ and $(6, p)$, where $p$ is an integer, are vertices of a triangle. What is the sum of the values of $p$ for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum?<|im_end|>

Well, so we have three points: A(3,5), B(9,11), and C(6,p), where p is an integer. We need to find all integer p such that the perimeter of triangle ABC is minimized, and then sum those p's. Hmm, perimeter is the sum of the three sides, right? So maybe I should first write expressions for each side length in terms of p, then add them up to get the perimeter function, and then find its minimum over integer p. Let's try that step by step.

First, let's compute the distances between each pair of points. Let's start with AB, since that's fixed, no p involved. Distance between A(3,5) and B(9,11): using distance formula, sqrt[(9-3)^2 + (11-5)^2] = sqrt[6^2 + 6^2] = sqrt[36 + 36] = sqrt[72] = 6*sqrt(2). Okay, so AB is constant, that's good to know—perimeter depends on AC and BC, since AB doesn't change. So perimeter P = AB + AC + BC = 6√2 + AC + BC. Therefore, minimizing the perimeter is equivalent to minimizing AC + BC. That simplifies things! So we{{{picked token: ' can' | entropy: 0.9523 | entropy@temp: 0.0923 | delta: 0.8600 | temp: 0.1260 | top5: ' can' (0.5531), ' don' (0.3355), ' just' (0.1089), ' need' (0.0016), ' only' (0.0008)}}} can just focus on minimizing AC + BC, where C is (6,p), integer p.

Let me write AC and BC as functions of p. Let's do AC first: distance from A(3,5) to C(6,p). So that's sqrt[(6-3)^2 + (p - 5)^2] = sqrt[3^2 + (p - 5)^2] = sqrt[9 + (p - 5)^2]. Similarly, BC is distance from B(9,11) to C(6,p): sqrt[(6 - 9)^2 + (p - 11)^2] = sqrt[(-3)^2 + (p - 11)^2] = sqrt[9 + (p - 11)^2]. Perfect, so now AC + BC = sqrt[(p - 5)^2 + 9] + sqrt[(p - 11)^2 + 9]. Let's denote f(p) = sqrt[(p - 5)^2 + 9] + sqrt[(p - 11)^2 + 9], so we need to minimize f(p) over integers p.

Wait a second, this looks like a problem where we can interpret the sum of distances as a reflection problem, maybe? Like in optics, the shortest path between two points via a line is found by reflecting one point over the line and taking the straight line distance. Let me recall: if you have two points on the same side of a line, the shortest path from one to the other via the line is equal to the straight line distance{{{picked token: ' between' | entropy: 0.8329 | entropy@temp: 0.0019 | delta: 0.8310 | temp: 0.0586 | top5: ' from' (0.5952), ' between' (0.3610), ' to' (0.0381), ' after' (0.0051), ' when' (0.0004)}}} between one point and the reflection of the other over the line. Here, our "line" might be... wait, actually, in this case, the point C is on the vertical line x=6, right? Because both coordinates of C are (6,p), so it's on the vertical line x=6. So maybe we can model this as: we have two points A and B, and we want a point C on the line x=6 such that AC + BC is minimized. Yes! That's exactly the classic reflection problem for minimizing path length with a constraint on the point.

Let me formalize that. Suppose we have a vertical line L: x = c. We want to minimize AC + BC where C ∈ L. Then the minimum occurs at the point where the line from A to B' (reflection of B over L) intersects L, or vice versa. Let's try that here. Our line L is x=6. Let's find the reflection of point A over line x=6 first, or point B? Let's pick one, say reflect B over x=6 to get B', then the straight line distance from A to B' should be equal to the minimal AC + BC, achieved when C is the intersection point of AB' with x=6.
...
Wait, let's take the intersection point of AB' with L (x=6). First, line AB': A is (3,5), B' is (3,11). Wait, that's a vertical line x=3! Oh no, that's a problem—vertical line x=3 doesn't intersect x=6 at all. Did I do the reflection wrong? Wait, maybe I should have reflected A instead of B? Let's try that.

Reflect A(3,5) over x=6: x-coordinate becomes 2*6 - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9, y-coordinate stays 5, so A'(9,5). Okay, that's better, let's see. Now, the minimal AC + BC should be equal to the straight line distance from A' to B, right? Wait, why? Let's recall: if you have point C on line L, then AC = A'C (since reflection preserves distance), so AC + BC = A'C + BC, which is minimized when C is on the{{{picked token: ' straight' | entropy: 0.8670 | entropy@temp: 0.0649 | delta: 0.8021 | temp: 0.1699 | top5: ' straight' (0.6218), ' line' (0.2937), ' segment' (0.0841), ' path' (0.0003), ' shortest' (0.0001)}}} straight line between A' and B (by triangle inequality, A'C + BC ≥ A'B, equality iff C is on segment A'B). Yes! That's the key. So reflection of A over L gives A', then AC + BC = A'C + BC ≥ A'B, so minimum is A'B when C is the intersection of A'B with L.

Okay, that makes more sense, I had the reflection direction wrong earlier. Let's do this carefully.
...
Let's check: line L is x=6. Point A(3,5): x=3 < 6, so left of L. Point B(9,11): x=9 > 6, so right of L. Oh! Wait a second! I think I made a mistake here: A and B are on opposite sides of the line x=6? Let's see: 3 < 6 < 9, yes! So A is left of L, B is right of L. Then, if two points are on opposite sides of a line, the minimal path from A to B via a point on the line is just the straight line from A to B, intersecting the line at some point C, and that C would minimize AC + BC (in fact, it's the unique point where the straight line crosses the line, so AC + BC = AB, which is the minimal possible, since for any other point C', AC' + BC' ≥ AB by triangle inequality).

Wait, hold on, is that true? Wait, no, wait: if you have two points on opposite sides of a line, then the straight line segment between them intersects the line at exactly one point, say C, and for any other point C' on the line, AC' + BC' > AC + BC = AB, by triangle inequality (since in triangle{{{picked token: ' AC' | entropy: 0.9599 | entropy@temp: 0.1009 | delta: 0.8590 | temp: 0.3438 | top5: ' AC' (0.6959), ' ABC' (0.1760), ' A' (0.0647), ' ACC' (0.0445), ' AB' (0.0164)}}} AC'B, AC' + BC' > AB). Yes! That's the case here. Let's confirm the positions again:

Line L: x=6. Point A(3,5): x=3 < 6 ⇒ left of L. Point B(9,11): x=9 > 6 ⇒ right of L. Therefore, segment AB crosses line L at some point C, and for this point C, AC + BC = AB (since it's colinear), which is the minimal possible sum (because for any other point C' on L, AC' + BC' ≥ AB, with equality iff C' is on segment AB).
...
Now, line AB intersects line L (x=6) at point C where x=6, so y=6 + 2=8. Therefore, the point C=(6,8) is on line AB, so AC + BC = AB, which is the minimal possible sum (by triangle inequality, as we said, since A and B are on opposite sides of x=6, so segment AB crosses x=6 at C, so any other C' on x=6 gives AC' + BC' > AB).

Wait, but hold on{{{picked token: '!' | entropy: 0.9588 | entropy@temp: 0.0602 | delta: 0.8987 | temp: 0.1387 | top5: '!' (0.5860), ',' (0.3137), ' a' (0.0899), '—' (0.0031), '—the' (0.0024)}}}! The problem says "the points (3,5), (9,11), and (6,p) are vertices of a triangle". Oh! Important point: they have to be non-colinear! Because if they are colinear, it's not a triangle, it's a degenerate triangle with zero area. So we need to make sure that C is not on line AB, otherwise the perimeter isn't a valid triangle perimeter (it would be a straight line, area zero, but the problem says "vertices of a triangle", so they must be non-colinear). Therefore, the minimal AC + BC is approached as C gets close to the intersection point (6,8), but since C can't be exactly (6,8) (it would be degenerate), we need to check integer p near 8? Wait, but hold on, let's step back and make sure.

Wait, let's compute AB first to be clear: AB = sqrt((9-3)^2 + (11-5)^2) = sqrt(36 + 36) = sqrt(72) = 6√2 �� 8.485, as we had before.
...
Wait, that seems like a good approach. Let's formalize this. Let's define f(p) = AC + BC = sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9), as we had earlier. We want to minimize f(p) over integers p, with the condition that the three points are not colinear (i.e., f(p) > AB = 6√2 �� 8.485). First, let's see what f(p) does as a function of real p, then check integer p near the minimum (which we thought was at p=8, but that's degenerate).

First, let's find the minimum of f(p) over real numbers p (ignoring the triangle condition for a{{{picked token: ' second' | entropy: 0.8365 | entropy@temp: 0.0000 | delta: 0.8365 | temp: 0.0147 | top5: ' second' (0.6894), ' moment' (0.1743), ' sec' (0.1357), ' minute' (0.0005), ' bit' (0.0001)}}} second). To find the minimum, take derivative and set to zero. Let's try calculus, maybe that's straightforward here.

Let f(p) = sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 3^2) + sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 3^2). Let's compute f'(p):
...
(p - 5)/sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) = - (p - 11)/sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9)

Let me denote u = p - 5, v = p - 11, so v = u - 6. Then the equation becomes u / sqrt(u² + 9) = - (u - 6)/sqrt((u - 6)² + 9). Hmm, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, notice that each term on the left is{{{picked token: ' a' | entropy: 1.0253 | entropy@temp: 0.0971 | delta: 0.9281 | temp: 0.3770 | top5: ' the' (0.7042), ' like' (0.1387), ' a' (0.0841), ' of' (0.0309), ' equal' (0.0241)}}} a cosine or sine of some angle? Wait, for a point (x, y), x / sqrt(x² + y²) is the cosine of the angle from the x-axis to the vector (x,y). Let's think geometrically.

Suppose we have a point C=(6,p) on x=6, and we consider the horizontal distances from C to A and B. Wait, from C(6,p) to A(3,5): horizontal distance is 6 - 3 = 3, vertical distance is |p - 5|, so AC is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 3 and |p - 5|. Similarly, BC is hypotenuse of right triangle with legs 3 (since 9 - 6 = 3) and |p - 11|.
...
So maybe we can model this as: for each p, we have two right triangles sharing the vertical leg? Wait, no, but if we think of the sum of hypotenuses, the minimal sum of hypotenuses for two right triangles with fixed horizontal legs (both 3) and vertical legs |p - 5| and |p - 11|.

Wait, another way: let's let t = p, so f(t) = sqrt((t - 5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((t - 11)^2 + 9). Let's compute f(t) at integer{{{picked token: ' values' | entropy: 0.8340 | entropy@temp: 0.0004 | delta: 0.8336 | temp: 0.0991 | top5: ' values' (0.6651), ' points' (0.2447), ' t' (0.0900), ' p' (0.0002), ' nearby' (0.0000)}}} values around 8, since we saw the degenerate point is at t=8.

Compute f(7): AC = sqrt((7-5)^2 + 9) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) �� 3.6055; BC = sqrt((7-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5; so f(7) �� 3.6055 + 5 = 8.6055
...
f(4): AC = sqrt(1 + 9)=sqrt(10)≈3.1623; BC=sqrt(49 + 9)=sqrt(58)≈7.6158; total≈10.778, bigger

Okay, so from these computations, f(7) and f(9) both give approximately 8.6055, which is the smallest non-degenerate value (since f(8) is degenerate, ~8.4853, but not a triangle). Wait, but hold on{{{picked token: ',' | entropy: 1.1853 | entropy@temp: 0.0313 | delta: 1.1540 | temp: 0.1309 | top5: ',' (0.5095), '—is' (0.2407), '—' (0.2124), '—are' (0.0224), '—the' (0.0064)}}}, is there a possibility of another integer p where f(p) is smaller? Let's check p=8 is the only one near 8, and we saw p=7,9 are symmetric.

Wait, but let's go back to the calculus derivative to confirm where the minimum of f(p) over real p is, to make sure we didn't miss anything. Earlier, we had f'(p) = (p - 5)/AC + (p - 11)/BC = 0. Let's solve for p.
...
Now, is sqrt(13) + 5 greater than 6√2? Let's square both sides to compare (since both are positive):

Left side squared: (5 + sqrt(13))² = 25 + 10{{{picked token: 'sqrt' | entropy: 0.9551 | entropy@temp: 0.0011 | delta: 0.9540 | temp: 0.0408 | top5: 'sqrt' (0.5294), '√' (0.3639), ' sqrt' (0.1042), '*' (0.0025), '.sqrt' (0.0000)}}}sqrt(13) + 13 = 38 + 10sqrt(13)

Right side squared: (6√2)² = 36*2 = 72
...
Wait, but hold on, is there a possibility that for some integer p further from 8, f(p) could be equal? But since the function is strictly monotonic on either side of 8 (we saw derivative at p=7 is negative, p=9 is positive, so decreasing then increasing, hence strictly monotonic on intervals), so for p < 8, f(p) is strictly decreasing as p increases, so f(7) < f(6) < f(5) < ... and for p > 8, f(p) is strictly increasing as p increases, so f(9) < f(10) < f(11) < ..., therefore f(7) = f(9) is the smallest non-degenerate f(p) (since f(8) is degenerate and smaller than both), and there are no other integers with the same f(p) value.

Let me just check p=8 is the only integer where it's degenerate{{{picked token: ',' | entropy: 1.0884 | entropy@temp: 0.2104 | delta: 0.8780 | temp: 0.4512 | top5: ',' (0.6755), ':' (0.1174), '?' (0.0914), ' (' (0.0628), '—' (0.0489)}}}, which we know: three points colinear iff C is on line AB, which we found at (6,8), so yes, only p=8 is degenerate.

Wait, another way to think about the triangle inequality: for three points to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So we need AC + BC > AB, AB + AC > BC, AB + BC > AC. But AB is fixed, let's check if the other inequalities hold for our p values.
...
So yes, p=7 and p=9 give the smallest perimeter for valid triangles (non-degenerate), and they are the only integers where this happens.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the values of p for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum". So we need to sum 7 and 9, which is 16? Wait, but hold on, let me just make sure there isn't a case where for some other integer p, maybe the perimeter is the same? But from the symmetry and monotonicity, since f(p) is strictly decreasing on (-∞,8) and strictly increasing on (8,∞), the only integer p with f(p) equal to f(7) are p=7 and p=9 (since f(7)=f(9), and for p<7, f(p) > f(7) because decreasing towards 8, so f(6) > f(7), etc{{{picked token: '.;' | entropy: 0.9090 | entropy@temp: 0.0716 | delta: 0.8374 | temp: 0.2314 | top5: '.,' (0.6562), '.;' (0.2414), '.),' (0.0888), '.)\n\n' (0.0064), '.).\n\n' (0.0039)}}}.; for p>9, f(p) > f(9) because increasing away from 8, so f(10) > f(9), etc.).

Is there a chance that for some p not near 8, f(p) equals f(7)? Let's suppose f(p) = f(7) = 5 + sqrt(13). But since f(p) has a global minimum at p=8, and is strictly decreasing before 8, strictly increasing after 8, the equation f(p) = c (for c > f(8)) has exactly two solutions: one less than 8, one greater than 8. For integer p, those two solutions would be the closest integers to 8 on either side, which are 7 and 9. So yes, only two integer p: 7 and 9.
...
Another check: let's compute the difference f(p) - f(8) for p=7 and p=9. Since f(8) is the minimum, f(p) - f(8) > 0 for p≠8, and we can see it's symmetric around p=8, so the minimal positive difference (for integer p) is at p=7 and 9.

I think we've covered all angles here. The key was realizing that the degenerate case is at p=8 (integer, but invalid for a triangle), so we have to take the{{{picked token: ' next' | entropy: 1.0411 | entropy@temp: 0.1419 | delta: 0.8992 | temp: 0.3848 | top5: ' next' (0.6774), ' integers' (0.1511), ' nearest' (0.0809), ' closest' (0.0714), ' integer' (0.0097)}}} next integers, which are symmetric around 8, giving the same perimeter, and those are the minimal non-degenerate perimeters.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't misread the problem: it says "the sum of the values of p for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum". So if there's only one p, sum is that p, but here there are two p's, 7 and 9, sum to 16.
...
3. Use symmetry and monotonicity to find integer p closest to 8 (not 8) that give minimal non-degenerate AC + BC.

The area formula was a nice confirmation that p=8 is the only degenerate case, and integer p=7,9 give equal area (hence symmetric, which we saw in the AC + BC values).

Just to make 100% sure, let's compute the perimeter exactly for p=7 and p=9 to see if they're equal (they should be by symmetry):
...
Therefore, the values of p are 7 and 9, sum is 16.

I don't think I missed any other p—since the function is strictly monotonic on either side of 8, there can't be another integer p with the same minimal perimeter (other than the symmetric ones).

Three points form a degenerate triangle (i.e., they lie on a straight line) when the area of the triangle is zero.
