This is a complex or challenging question, and it is difficult to provide a direct and correct answer. I need to think about it.
Well, so we have three points: A(3,5), B(9,11), and C(6,p), where p is an integer. We need to find all integer p such that the perimeter of triangle ABC is minimized, and then sum those p's. Hmm, perimeter is the sum of the three sides, right? So maybe I should first write expressions for each side length in terms of p, then add them up to get the perimeter function, and then find its minimum over integer p. Let's try that step by step.

First, let's compute the distances between each pair of points. Let's start with AB, since that's fixed, no p involved. Distance between A(3,5) and B(9,11): using distance formula, sqrt[(9-3)^2 + (11-5)^2] = sqrt[6^2 + 6^2] = sqrt[36 + 36] = sqrt[72] = 6*sqrt(2). Okay, so AB is constant, that's good to know—perimeter depends on AC and BC, since AB doesn't change. So perimeter P = AB + AC + BC = 6√2 + AC + BC. Therefore, minimizing the perimeter is equivalent to minimizing AC + BC. That simplifies things! So we can just focus on minimizing AC + BC, where C is (6,p), integer p.

Let me write AC and BC as functions of p. Let's do AC first: distance from A(3,5) to C(6,p). So that's sqrt[(6-3)^2 + (p - 5)^2] = sqrt[3^2 + (p - 5)^2] = sqrt[9 + (p - 5)^2]. Similarly, BC is distance from B(9,11) to C(6,p): sqrt[(6 - 9)^2 + (p - 11)^2] = sqrt[(-3)^2 + (p - 11)^2] = sqrt[9 + (p - 11)^2]. Perfect, so now AC + BC = sqrt[(p - 5)^2 + 9] + sqrt[(p - 11)^2 + 9]. Let's denote f(p) = sqrt[(p - 5)^2 + 9] + sqrt[(p - 11)^2 + 9], so we need to minimize f(p) over integers p.

Wait a second, this looks like a problem where we can interpret the sum of distances as a reflection problem, maybe? Like in optics, the shortest path between two points via a line is found by reflecting one point over the line and taking the straight line distance. Let me recall: if you have two points on the same side of a line, the shortest path from one to the other via the line is equal to the straight line distance between one point and the reflection of the other over the line. Here, our "line" might be... wait, actually, in this case, the point C is on the vertical line x=6, right? Because both coordinates of C are (6,p), so it's on the vertical line x=6. So maybe we can model this as: we have two points A and B, and we want a point C on the line x=6 such that AC + BC is minimized. Yes! That's exactly the classic reflection problem for minimizing path length with a constraint on the point.

Let me formalize that. Suppose we have a vertical line L: x = c. We want to minimize AC + BC where C ∈ L. Then the minimum occurs at the point where the line from A to B' (reflection of B over L) intersects L, or vice versa. Let's try that here. Our line L is x=6. Let's find the reflection of point A over line x=6 first, or point B? Let's pick one, say reflect B over x=6 to get B', then the straight line distance from A to B' should be equal to the minimal AC + BC, achieved when C is the intersection point of AB' with x=6.

Let's compute reflection of B(9,11) over x=6. To reflect a point over a vertical line x = c, the x-coordinate becomes 2c - x, y-coordinate stays the same. So c=6, so reflection B' has x = 2*6 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3, y=11. So B'(3,11). Wait, let's check: distance from B to x=6 is 9 - 6 = 3, so reflection should be 3 units left of x=6, so 6 - 3 = 3, yes, so x=3, y=11, correct.

Now, what's the distance from A(3,5) to B'(3,11)? Wait, that's a vertical line! Both have x=3, so distance is |11 - 5| = 6. Wait, but hold on, is that the minimal AC + BC? Wait, but in the reflection principle, the minimal AC + BC should equal AB' when C is on L, right? Let's verify with coordinates.

Wait, let's take the intersection point of AB' with L (x=6). First, line AB': A is (3,5), B' is (3,11). Wait, that's a vertical line x=3! Oh no, that's a problem—vertical line x=3 doesn't intersect x=6 at all. Did I do the reflection wrong? Wait, maybe I should have reflected A instead of B? Let's try that.

Reflect A(3,5) over x=6: x-coordinate becomes 2*6 - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9, y-coordinate stays 5, so A'(9,5). Okay, that's better, let's see. Now, the minimal AC + BC should be equal to the straight line distance from A' to B, right? Wait, why? Let's recall: if you have point C on line L, then AC = A'C (since reflection preserves distance), so AC + BC = A'C + BC, which is minimized when C is on the straight line between A' and B (by triangle inequality, A'C + BC ≥ A'B, equality iff C is on segment A'B). Yes! That's the key. So reflection of A over L gives A', then AC + BC = A'C + BC ≥ A'B, so minimum is A'B when C is the intersection of A'B with L.

Okay, that makes more sense, I had the reflection direction wrong earlier. Let's do this carefully.

Line L: x = 6 (where point C lies, so C=(6,p) ∈ L).

Reflect point A(3,5) over line L: x=6. As above, for vertical line x=c, reflection of (x,y) is (2c - x, y). So c=6, so reflection A' = (2*6 - 3, 5) = (12 - 3, 5) = (9,5). Good, that's a point with x=9, same y as A.

Now, for any point C on L (x=6), AC = A'C, because reflection preserves distances to points on the line (the line is the perpendicular bisector of segment AA'). Let's check that quickly: midpoint of AA' is ((3+9)/2, (5+5)/2) = (6,5), which is on L (x=6), and the line AA' is horizontal (same y=5), so yes, L is the perpendicular bisector, so distances from C to A and C to A' are equal. Perfect, so AC = A'C for all C ∈ L.

Therefore, AC + BC = A'C + BC. Now, by the triangle inequality, for any point C, A'C + BC ≥ A'B, with equality if and only if C lies on the line segment A'B (assuming A' and B are distinct, which they are). So that means the minimal value of AC + BC is equal to A'B, achieved exactly when C is the intersection point of line A'B with L (x=6).

Great, so let's compute A'B first to know the minimal sum (though maybe we don't need the actual minimal value, just need to find the p where equality holds, i.e., where C is on A'B).

First, coordinates: A' is (9,5), B is (9,11). Wait a second! Both A' and B have x-coordinate 9? So line A'B is the vertical line x=9? But line L is x=6, which is parallel to x=9? Wait, hold on, that can't be—parallel lines don't intersect, so that would mean there's no intersection point? But that contradicts the triangle inequality? Wait, no, wait, triangle inequality says A'C + BC ≥ A'B, but if A' and B are on the same side of L? Wait, no, we reflected A over L to get A', so A and A' are on opposite sides of L, right? Let's check positions:

Point A is (3,5), line L is x=6, so A is to the left of L (x=3 < 6). Reflection A' should be to the right of L, which (9,5) is (x=9 > 6), good. Point B is (9,11), which is also to the right of L (x=9 > 6). Wait a second! Both B and A' are on the same side of L (x=6)? That's the problem! When you reflect one point over the line, if both original points are on the same side, then the reflection might be on the same side or opposite, but in this case, A is left of L, A' is right of L; B is right of L, so yes, A' and B are both right of L, so line A'B is entirely to the right of L, so it doesn't intersect L. Wait, but then the triangle inequality still holds, but the minimum isn't achieved on the line segment because they're on the same side? Wait, no, actually, in the reflection principle for minimizing path with a point on a line, the key is that if the two points are on the same side of the line, you reflect one over the line to get the minimal path, but if they're on opposite sides, the minimal path is just the straight line between them (but in this case, are A and B on the same side or opposite sides of L?).

Let's check: line L is x=6. Point A(3,5): x=3 < 6, so left of L. Point B(9,11): x=9 > 6, so right of L. Oh! Wait a second! I think I made a mistake here: A and B are on opposite sides of the line x=6? Let's see: 3 < 6 < 9, yes! So A is left of L, B is right of L. Then, if two points are on opposite sides of a line, the minimal path from A to B via a point on the line is just the straight line from A to B, intersecting the line at some point C, and that C would minimize AC + BC (in fact, it's the unique point where the straight line crosses the line, so AC + BC = AB, which is the minimal possible, since for any other point C', AC' + BC' ≥ AB by triangle inequality).

Wait, hold on, is that true? Wait, no, wait: if you have two points on opposite sides of a line, then the straight line segment between them intersects the line at exactly one point, say C, and for any other point C' on the line, AC' + BC' > AC + BC = AB, by triangle inequality (since in triangle AC'B, AC' + BC' > AB). Yes! That's the case here. Let's confirm the positions again:

Line L: x=6. Point A(3,5): x=3 < 6 ⇒ left of L. Point B(9,11): x=9 > 6 ⇒ right of L. Therefore, segment AB crosses line L at some point C, and for this point C, AC + BC = AB (since it's colinear), which is the minimal possible sum (because for any other point C' on L, AC' + BC' ≥ AB, with equality iff C' is on segment AB).

Wait, but hold on, in our problem, the perimeter is AB + AC + BC, but AB is fixed, so minimizing perimeter is minimizing AC + BC, which in this case, since A and B are on opposite sides of L (x=6), the minimal AC + BC is AB itself, achieved when C is the intersection of AB with L. But wait, is that correct? Wait, let's compute the intersection point of AB with x=6, that would be the point C where AC + BC is minimized, right?

Wait, maybe I confused myself with the reflection principle earlier because I didn't check the positions first. Let's just compute the equation of line AB and find where it crosses x=6, that should give the minimal AC + BC.

First, coordinates of A(3,5) and B(9,11). Let's find the equation of line AB. Slope m = (11 - 5)/(9 - 3) = 6/6 = 1. So slope is 1. Equation using point A: y - 5 = 1*(x - 3) ⇒ y = x - 3 + 5 ⇒ y = x + 2. Let's check with point B: x=9, y=9 + 2=11, correct, good.

Now, line AB intersects line L (x=6) at point C where x=6, so y=6 + 2=8. Therefore, the point C=(6,8) is on line AB, so AC + BC = AB, which is the minimal possible sum (by triangle inequality, as we said, since A and B are on opposite sides of x=6, so segment AB crosses x=6 at C, so any other C' on x=6 gives AC' + BC' > AB).

Wait, but hold on! The problem says "the points (3,5), (9,11), and (6,p) are vertices of a triangle". Oh! Important point: they have to be non-colinear! Because if they are colinear, it's not a triangle, it's a degenerate triangle with zero area. So we need to make sure that C is not on line AB, otherwise the perimeter isn't a valid triangle perimeter (it would be a straight line, area zero, but the problem says "vertices of a triangle", so they must be non-colinear). Therefore, the minimal AC + BC is approached as C gets close to the intersection point (6,8), but since C can't be exactly (6,8) (it would be degenerate), we need to check integer p near 8? Wait, but hold on, let's step back and make sure.

Wait, let's compute AB first to be clear: AB = sqrt((9-3)^2 + (11-5)^2) = sqrt(36 + 36) = sqrt(72) = 6√2 �� 8.485, as we had before.

Now, let's compute AC + BC at p=8: C=(6,8). Then AC = sqrt((6-3)^2 + (8-5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) = 3√2 �� 4.242. BC = sqrt((6-9)^2 + (8-11)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) = 3√2 �� 4.242. So AC + BC = 6√2, which equals AB! Wait a second! So AC + BC = AB, which means the three points are colinear (since AC + BC = AB), so that's degenerate. Therefore, the problem states "vertices of a triangle", so we must have AC + BC > AB, so C cannot be on line AB. Therefore, the minimal perimeter (for a non-degenerate triangle) will be the minimal value of AC + BC that's greater than AB, achieved at integer p closest to 8, but we need to check both integers around 8, maybe 7 and 9, since 8 is the degenerate point.

Wait, that seems like a good approach. Let's formalize this. Let's define f(p) = AC + BC = sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9), as we had earlier. We want to minimize f(p) over integers p, with the condition that the three points are not colinear (i.e., f(p) > AB = 6√2 �� 8.485). First, let's see what f(p) does as a function of real p, then check integer p near the minimum (which we thought was at p=8, but that's degenerate).

First, let's find the minimum of f(p) over real numbers p (ignoring the triangle condition for a second). To find the minimum, take derivative and set to zero. Let's try calculus, maybe that's straightforward here.

Let f(p) = sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 3^2) + sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 3^2). Let's compute f'(p):

f'(p) = [2(p - 5)]/[2 sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9)] + [2(p - 11)]/[2 sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9)] = (p - 5)/sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) + (p - 11)/sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9)

Set derivative equal to zero for critical points:

(p - 5)/sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) = - (p - 11)/sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9)

Let me denote u = p - 5, v = p - 11, so v = u - 6. Then the equation becomes u / sqrt(u² + 9) = - (u - 6)/sqrt((u - 6)² + 9). Hmm, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, notice that each term on the left is a cosine or sine of some angle? Wait, for a point (x, y), x / sqrt(x² + y²) is the cosine of the angle from the x-axis to the vector (x,y). Let's think geometrically.

Suppose we have a point C=(6,p) on x=6, and we consider the horizontal distances from C to A and B. Wait, from C(6,p) to A(3,5): horizontal distance is 6 - 3 = 3, vertical distance is |p - 5|, so AC is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 3 and |p - 5|. Similarly, BC is hypotenuse of right triangle with legs 3 (since 9 - 6 = 3) and |p - 11|.

So maybe we can model this as: for each p, we have two right triangles sharing the vertical leg? Wait, no, but if we think of the sum of hypotenuses, the minimal sum of hypotenuses for two right triangles with fixed horizontal legs (both 3) and vertical legs |p - 5| and |p - 11|.

Wait, another way: let's let t = p, so f(t) = sqrt((t - 5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((t - 11)^2 + 9). Let's compute f(t) at integer values around 8, since we saw the degenerate point is at t=8.

Compute f(7): AC = sqrt((7-5)^2 + 9) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) �� 3.6055; BC = sqrt((7-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5; so f(7) �� 3.6055 + 5 = 8.6055

f(8): as before, sqrt(9 + 9) + sqrt(9 + 9) = 2*sqrt(18) = 6*sqrt(2) �� 8.4853 (this is degenerate, so not allowed for a triangle)

f(9): AC = sqrt((9-5)^2 + 9) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5; BC = sqrt((9-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13) �� 3.6055; so f(9) �� 5 + 3.6055 = 8.6055, same as f(7) due to symmetry!

Wait, that's interesting. Let's check f(6) and f(10) to see if they are larger, to confirm the minimum.

f(6): AC = sqrt((6-5)^2 + 9) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) �� 3.1623; BC = sqrt((6-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34) �� 5.8309; total �� 3.1623 + 5.8309 �� 8.9932, which is bigger than ~8.6055

f(10): AC = sqrt((10-5)^2 + 9) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34) �� 5.8309; BC = sqrt((10-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) �� 3.1623; total same as f(6) �� 8.9932

f(5): AC = sqrt(0 + 9) = 3; BC = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) = 3√5 �� 6.7082; total �� 9.7082, bigger

f(11): similar to f(5), total �� 9.7082

f(4): AC = sqrt(1 + 9)=sqrt(10)≈3.1623; BC=sqrt(49 + 9)=sqrt(58)≈7.6158; total≈10.778, bigger

Okay, so from these computations, f(7) and f(9) both give approximately 8.6055, which is the smallest non-degenerate value (since f(8) is degenerate, ~8.4853, but not a triangle). Wait, but hold on, is there a possibility of another integer p where f(p) is smaller? Let's check p=8 is the only one near 8, and we saw p=7,9 are symmetric.

Wait, but let's go back to the calculus derivative to confirm where the minimum of f(p) over real p is, to make sure we didn't miss anything. Earlier, we had f'(p) = (p - 5)/AC + (p - 11)/BC = 0. Let's solve for p.

Let’s denote for a general point (x,y), the derivative term (x)/sqrt(x² + y²) is the cosine of the angle that the vector (x,y) makes with the positive x-axis, but maybe more simply, let's square both sides? Wait, but we have to be careful with signs.

From f'(p) = 0: (p - 5)/sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) = - (p - 11)/sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9)

Let’s let a = p - 5, so p - 11 = a - 6. Then the equation becomes:

a / sqrt(a² + 9) = - (a - 6) / sqrt((a - 6)² + 9)

Let’s denote left side as L, right side as R. Let's compute L and R for a=3 (since p=8 ⇒ a=3):

L = 3 / sqrt(9 + 9) = 3/(3√2) = 1/√2 �� 0.7071

R = - (3 - 6)/sqrt((3 - 6)² + 9) = - (-3)/sqrt(9 + 9) = 3/(3√2) = 1/√2 �� 0.7071

Oh! Wait, when a=3 (p=8), L = R, so f'(8)=0? But earlier we saw f(8)=6√2, which is the degenerate case. Wait, but hold on, when we computed f'(8), let's plug p=8 into f'(p):

(p - 5)/sqrt((p - 5)^2 + 9) = (3)/sqrt(9 + 9) = 3/(3√2) = 1/√2

(p - 11)/sqrt((p - 11)^2 + 9) = (-3)/sqrt(9 + 9) = -1/√2

Therefore, f'(8) = 1/√2 + (-1/√2) = 0. Oh! So p=8 is a critical point of f(p) over real numbers! That makes sense, we just didn't realize it's a critical point (the minimum over reals is at p=8, but it's degenerate for the triangle).

Wait, so f(p) has a minimum at p=8 (real number), with f(8)=6√2≈8.4853, but since the problem requires three non-colinear points (a triangle), we need p≠8, so we need the next smallest values of f(p) for integer p≠8.

Now, let's analyze the function f(p) around p=8. Since it's differentiable at p=8, and it's a minimum (we can check second derivative or test values around), for p < 8, let's take p=7: f'(7) = (7-5)/sqrt(4+9) + (7-11)/sqrt(16+9) = 2/sqrt(13) - 4/5 �� 2/3.6055 - 0.8 �� 0.5547 - 0.8 �� -0.2453 < 0

For p > 8, take p=9: f'(9) = (9-5)/sqrt(16+9) + (9-11)/sqrt(4+9) = 4/5 - 2/sqrt(13) �� 0.8 - 0.5547 �� 0.2453 > 0

Ah, so the function f(p) is decreasing on (-∞, 8) and increasing on (8, ��) (since derivative goes from negative to positive at p=8), so p=8 is the global minimum on reals, and the function is symmetric? Wait, is f(p) symmetric around p=8?

Let's check: let q = p - 8, so shift variable to center at 8. Then f(8 + q) = sqrt((8 + q - 5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((8 + q - 11)^2 + 9) = sqrt((q + 3)^2 + 9) + sqrt((q - 3)^2 + 9). Ah! Yes! So f(8 + q) = sqrt((q + 3)^2 + 9) + sqrt((q - 3)^2 + 9), which is even in q (replace q with -q, same thing). Therefore, f(p) is symmetric about p=8. That's a key symmetry I missed earlier!

So f(8 + q) = f(8 - q) for all q. Therefore, integer p near 8 will come in symmetric pairs around 8: p=8+q and p=8-q have the same f(p) value.

So the integer values: p=7 is 8-1, p=9 is 8+1; p=6 is 8-2, p=10 is 8+2; etc. And due to symmetry, f(7)=f(9), f(6)=f(10), f(5)=f(11), etc., which matches what we computed earlier (f(7)=f(9)≈8.6055, f(6)=f(10)≈8.9932, etc.)

Since the function f(p) has a global minimum at p=8 (degenerate triangle), and increases as we move away from p=8 in either direction (since it's decreasing before 8, increasing after 8), the smallest non-degenerate values of f(p) for integer p will be the integer values closest to 8, i.e., p=7 and p=9, because those are the integers immediately adjacent to 8, and due to symmetry, they give the same f(p) value, which is smaller than f(p) for any other integer p (since next closest are p=6 and p=10, which we saw give larger f(p)).

Wait, but hold on, let's make sure there isn't a case where for some integer p not near 8, f(p) is smaller? But since the function is decreasing on (-∞,8) and increasing on (8,∞), the minimal values for integer p will be the integers closest to 8, which are 7 and 9. Let's just confirm once more with exact values to be precise (maybe we don't need approximations, since we want to compare f(7) vs f(8) vs f(9) exactly).

First, f(8) = 6√2 ��8.48528

f(7) = sqrt((7-5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((7-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(4 + 9) + sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(13) + 5

f(9) = sqrt((9-5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((9-11)^2 + 9) = sqrt(16 + 9) + sqrt(4 + 9) = 5 + sqrt(13), same as f(7), good.

Now, is sqrt(13) + 5 greater than 6√2? Let's square both sides to compare (since both are positive):

Left side squared: (5 + sqrt(13))² = 25 + 10sqrt(13) + 13 = 38 + 10sqrt(13)

Right side squared: (6√2)² = 36*2 = 72

Compare 38 + 10sqrt(13) vs 72 ⇒ 10sqrt(13) vs 34 ⇒ sqrt(13) vs 3.4 ⇒ 13 vs 11.56 ⇒ 13 > 11.56, so yes, 10sqrt(13) > 34 ⇒ 38 + 10sqrt(13) > 72 ⇒ 5 + sqrt(13) > 6√2. So f(7) and f(9) are indeed greater than f(8), as expected.

What about f(8) vs f(7) (degenerate vs non-degenerate): since f(8) is the minimum over reals, and f(p) is continuous, for p≠8, f(p) > f(8), so all non-degenerate triangles have perimeter greater than AB + AB = 2AB? Wait, no: perimeter is AB + AC + BC = 6√2 + f(p), so perimeter at p=8 would be 6√2 + 6√2 = 12√2, but that's degenerate (area zero), so not a triangle. For p=7 or 9, perimeter is 6√2 + 5 + sqrt(13), which is greater than 12√2? Wait, no: 12√2 ��16.97, 6√2 + 5 + sqrt(13)≈8.485 + 5 + 3.606≈17.091, which is slightly larger, correct.

But we don't need to compare perimeters directly, since we already established that minimizing perimeter is equivalent to minimizing f(p), and f(p) has minimum at p=8 (degenerate), so next smallest f(p) for integers are p=7 and 9, both giving same f(p), so both give minimal perimeter for non-degenerate triangles.

Wait, but the problem says "the sum of the values of p for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum". So we need to make sure there are no other integer p with the same minimal perimeter (i.e., same f(p) as f(7) and f(9)). But from the symmetry and the monotonicity (decreasing before 8, increasing after 8), the function f(p) is strictly decreasing on (-∞,8) and strictly increasing on (8,∞), so for integer p, the values f(p) decrease as p increases towards 8, reach minimum at p=8, then increase as p increases away from 8. Therefore, the integer p closest to 8 (on either side) will give the smallest non-degenerate f(p), and since they are symmetric, they give the same f(p), so they are the only two integer p with minimal perimeter.

Wait, but hold on, is there a possibility that for some integer p further from 8, f(p) could be equal? But since the function is strictly monotonic on either side of 8 (we saw derivative at p=7 is negative, p=9 is positive, so decreasing then increasing, hence strictly monotonic on intervals), so for p < 8, f(p) is strictly decreasing as p increases, so f(7) < f(6) < f(5) < ... and for p > 8, f(p) is strictly increasing as p increases, so f(9) < f(10) < f(11) < ..., therefore f(7) = f(9) is the smallest non-degenerate f(p) (since f(8) is degenerate and smaller than both), and there are no other integers with the same f(p) value.

Let me just check p=8 is the only integer where it's degenerate, which we know: three points colinear iff C is on line AB, which we found at (6,8), so yes, only p=8 is degenerate.

Wait, another way to think about the triangle inequality: for three points to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So we need AC + BC > AB, AB + AC > BC, AB + BC > AC. But AB is fixed, let's check if the other inequalities hold for our p values.

First, AB = 6√2 ��8.485. AC and BC for p=7: AC=sqrt(13)≈3.606, BC=5. So check AB + AC > BC: 8.485 + 3.606 > 5, yes. AB + BC > AC: 8.485 + 5 > 3.606, yes. AC + BC > AB: 3.606 + 5 > 8.485 ⇒ 8.606 > 8.485, which is true, so that's the non-degenerate condition (the strict inequality here is what makes it a triangle, not degenerate).

For p=8: AC + BC = AB, so degenerate, not a triangle, so excluded.

For p=6: AC=sqrt(10)≈3.162, BC=sqrt(34)≈5.831, AC + BC≈8.993 > AB≈8.485, so that's a valid triangle, but perimeter is larger than p=7,9.

So seems like p=7 and p=9 are the only integer p giving minimal perimeter (for non-degenerate triangles).

Wait, but let's make sure we didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says "the points (3,5), (9,11) and (6,p), where p is an integer, are vertices of a triangle". So they must form a triangle, so non-colinear, which we've accounted for by excluding p=8.

Is there any other integer p where maybe AC + BC is smaller? Let's see, suppose p=8 is the only real minimum, and since the function is convex (second derivative positive, probably), it's a convex function, so the minimum over integers is at the integer closest to the real minimum, but since the real minimum is at integer p=8 (wait, p=8 is integer!), but it's degenerate. Wait, hold on! p=8 is an integer, but it gives a degenerate triangle, so it's not allowed. So the next integers away from 8 are 7 and 9, both integers, both give the same perimeter (since f(p) is symmetric), and since the function is decreasing before 8 and increasing after 8, these are the minimal non-degenerate perimeters.

Wait, let's confirm with another method to be 100% sure. Let's compute the perimeter for p=7 and p=9 numerically and see if they're equal and smaller than others.

Perimeter at p=7: AB + AC + BC = 6√2 + sqrt(13) + 5 ��8.48528 + 3.60555 + 5 ��17.0908

Perimeter at p=8: 6√2 + 6√2 = 12√2 ��16.9706, but degenerate, so not a triangle (the problem says "vertices of a triangle", so must be non-degenerate, so p=8 is invalid)

Perimeter at p=6: 6√2 + sqrt(10) + sqrt(34) ��8.48528 + 3.16228 + 5.83095 ��17.4785, which is larger than p=7,9

Perimeter at p=9: same as p=7, by symmetry, ��17.0908

Perimeter at p=5: 6√2 + 3 + 3√5 ��8.48528 + 3 + 6.70820 ��18.1935, larger

So yes, p=7 and p=9 give the smallest perimeter for valid triangles (non-degenerate), and they are the only integers where this happens.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the values of p for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum". So we need to sum 7 and 9, which is 16? Wait, but hold on, let me just make sure there isn't a case where for some other integer p, maybe the perimeter is the same? But from the symmetry and monotonicity, since f(p) is strictly decreasing on (-∞,8) and strictly increasing on (8,∞), the only integer p with f(p) equal to f(7) are p=7 and p=9 (since f(7)=f(9), and for p<7, f(p) > f(7) because decreasing towards 8, so f(6) > f(7), etc.; for p>9, f(p) > f(9) because increasing away from 8, so f(10) > f(9), etc.).

Is there a chance that for some p not near 8, f(p) equals f(7)? Let's suppose f(p) = f(7) = 5 + sqrt(13). But since f(p) has a global minimum at p=8, and is strictly decreasing before 8, strictly increasing after 8, the equation f(p) = c (for c > f(8)) has exactly two solutions: one less than 8, one greater than 8. For integer p, those two solutions would be the closest integers to 8 on either side, which are 7 and 9. So yes, only two integer p: 7 and 9.

Wait, just to be thorough, let's solve f(p) = f(7) for real p, to see if there are only two solutions. f(p) = sqrt((p-5)^2 + 9) + sqrt((p-11)^2 + 9) = 5 + sqrt(13). But from the symmetry, we know p=7 and p=9 are solutions, and since it's a convex function (second derivative positive), there are exactly two real solutions, which are 7 and 9, so for integers, only those two.

Another check: let's compute the difference f(p) - f(8) for p=7 and p=9. Since f(8) is the minimum, f(p) - f(8) > 0 for p≠8, and we can see it's symmetric around p=8, so the minimal positive difference (for integer p) is at p=7 and 9.

I think we've covered all angles here. The key was realizing that the degenerate case is at p=8 (integer, but invalid for a triangle), so we have to take the next integers, which are symmetric around 8, giving the same perimeter, and those are the minimal non-degenerate perimeters.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't misread the problem: it says "the sum of the values of p for which the perimeter of the triangle is a minimum". So if there's only one p, sum is that p, but here there are two p's, 7 and 9, sum to 16.

Wait, let's check once more if p=8 is the only degenerate case. Three points colinear iff the area is zero. Area of triangle with vertices (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3) is (1/2)| (x2 - x1)(y3 - y1) - (x3 - x1)(y2 - y1) |. Let's compute area for C=(6,p):

Area = (1/2)| (9 - 3)(p - 5) - (6 - 3)(11 - 5) | = (1/2)| 6(p - 5) - 3*6 | = (1/2)| 6p - 30 - 18 | = (1/2)|6p - 48| = 3|p - 8|.

Ah! That's a great way to see it. The area is 3|p - 8|, so area is zero iff p=8, which confirms that p=8 is the only degenerate case (area zero), and for all other integer p, area is positive, so valid triangle.

This area formula also shows that the area increases as |p - 8| increases, so the area is minimized at p=8 (degenerate), and the next smallest areas (for integer p) are at p=7 and p=9, where area=3|7-8|=3 and 3|9-8|=3, so same area, which makes sense due to symmetry.

But how does area relate to perimeter? Well, for fixed base AB, the perimeter is AB + AC + BC, and AC + BC is related to the "height" from C to AB? Wait, maybe not necessary, but since we have the area formula, we know that for non-degenerate triangles, p≠8, and we want minimal perimeter.

But earlier, we saw that minimizing AC + BC is equivalent to minimizing perimeter, and AC + BC is minimized at p=8 (degenerate), so next minimal at p=7,9.

Wait, another thought: is there a case where even though AC + BC is slightly larger than at p=8, the perimeter could be smaller? No, because AB is fixed, so perimeter = constant + AC + BC, so minimizing perimeter is exactly minimizing AC + BC.

We already did the calculus, saw the minimum of AC + BC is at p=8, function is symmetric around p=8, decreasing before, increasing after, so integer p closest to 8 (excluding 8 itself) are 7 and 9, both give same AC + BC, which is minimal for non-degenerate triangles.

I think this is solid. The key steps were:

1. Recognize AB is fixed, so minimize AC + BC.

2. Realize the minimum of AC + BC is at p=8 (degenerate, so not a triangle).

3. Use symmetry and monotonicity to find integer p closest to 8 (not 8) that give minimal non-degenerate AC + BC.

4. Confirm via multiple methods (direct computation, calculus, area formula, symmetry) that p=7 and p=9 are the only such integers.

5. Sum them: 7 + 9 = 16.

I don't see any gaps here. Initially, I confused myself with the reflection principle because I misapplied it, but by computing the line AB and seeing the degenerate point, then verifying with calculus and symmetry, it all lined up. The area formula was a nice confirmation that p=8 is the only degenerate case, and integer p=7,9 give equal area (hence symmetric, which we saw in the AC + BC values).

Just to make 100% sure, let's compute the perimeter exactly for p=7 and p=9 to see if they're equal (they should be by symmetry):

Perimeter at p=7: 6√2 + sqrt((7-5)^2 + 3^2) + sqrt((7-11)^2 + 3^2) = 6√2 + sqrt(4 + 9) + sqrt(16 + 9) = 6√2 + sqrt(13) + 5

Perimeter at p=9: 6√2 + sqrt((9-5)^2 + 3^2) + sqrt((9-11)^2 + 3^2) = 6√2 + sqrt(16 + 9) + sqrt(4 + 9) = 6√2 + 5 + sqrt(13), same as above.

So they are equal, as expected. For any other integer p, as we saw with p=6, the perimeter is larger.

Therefore, the values of p are 7 and 9, sum is 16.

I think that's the answer. The problem says "the sum of the values of p", implying there might be more than one, which there are (two), and they sum to 16. I don't think I missed any other p—since the function is strictly monotonic on either side of 8, there can't be another integer p with the same minimal perimeter (other than the symmetric ones).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{16}
</think>

To solve the problem, we are given three points:

- $ A = (3, 5) $
- $ B = (9, 11) $
- $ C = (6, p) $, where $ p \in \mathbb{Z} $

We are to find the **sum of all integer values of $ p $** such that the **perimeter of triangle $ ABC $ is minimized**, under the condition that the three points form a **non-degenerate triangle**.

---

### Step 1: Understand What Minimizing the Perimeter Means

The perimeter of triangle $ ABC $ is:
$$
\text{Perimeter} = AB + AC + BC
$$
Since $ A $ and $ B $ are fixed, the length $ AB $ is constant. Therefore, minimizing the perimeter is equivalent to minimizing:
$$
AC + BC
$$

Let’s compute $ AC $ and $ BC $ in terms of $ p $:

- $ AC = \sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (p - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + (p - 5)^2} $
- $ BC = \sqrt{(6 - 9)^2 + (p - 11)^2} = \sqrt{9 + (p - 11)^2} $

So,
$$
f(p) = AC + BC = \sqrt{(p - 5)^2 + 9} + \sqrt{(p - 11)^2 + 9}
$$

We want to minimize $ f(p) $ over **integers $ p $** such that the triangle is **non-degenerate**.

---

### Step 2: Determine When Triangle Is Degenerate

Three points form a degenerate triangle (i.e., they lie on a straight line) when the area of the triangle is zero.

Using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices $ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3) $:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) - (x_3 - x_1)(y_2 - y_1)|
$$

Substitute $ A = (3, 5) $, $ B = (9, 11) $, $ C = (6, p) $:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(9 - 3)(p - 5) - (6 - 3)(11 - 5)| = \frac{1}{2} |6(p - 5) - 18| = 3|p - 8|
$$

So the area is zero **only when $ p = 8 $**. Thus, **$ p = 8 $** gives a **degenerate triangle**, which is **not valid** for our problem.

---

### Step 3: Find Integer Values of $ p $ That Minimize $ f(p) $ (for Non-Degenerate Triangles)

We now look for **integer values of $ p \neq 8 $** that minimize $ f(p) $.

From earlier analysis and symmetry, the function $ f(p) $ has a **global minimum at $ p = 8 $**, but this is **degenerate**. Since the function is **strictly decreasing** on $ (-\infty, 8) $ and **strictly increasing** on $ (8, \infty) $, the next smallest values of $ f(p) $ occur at the **integers closest to 8** — namely:

- $ p = 7 $
- $ p = 9 $

These two values yield the **smallest non-degenerate perimeters**.

Let’s verify:

- For $ p = 7 $:
  $$
  f(7) = \sqrt{(7 - 5)^2 + 9} + \sqrt{(7 - 11)^2 + 9} = \sqrt{4 + 9} + \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{13} + 5
  $$

- For $ p = 9 $:
  $$
  f(9) = \sqrt{(9 - 5)^2 + 9} + \sqrt{(9 - 11)^2 + 9} = \sqrt{16 + 9} + \sqrt{4 + 9} = 5 + \sqrt{13}
  $$

So $ f(7) = f(9) $, and both are **greater than $ f(8) $** (which is $ 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.485 $), confirming that these are the **minimal valid perimeters**.

All other integer values of $ p $ (e.g., $ p = 6, 10 $) give larger values of $ f(p) $, as shown through direct computation and monotonicity.

---

### Step 4: Compute the Required Sum

The problem asks for the **sum of the values of $ p $** for which the perimeter is **minimized** (and the triangle is non-degenerate).

We have found that the only such integer values are:

$$
p = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad p = 9
$$

Thus, the sum is:

$$
7 + 9 = \boxed{16}
$$

---
