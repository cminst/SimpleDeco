You are tasked with implementing a function that maps logging levels to their corresponding integer values. You will be given a dictionary that contains different logging levels (e.g., 'INFO', 'DEBUG', 'ERROR', 'WARN') as keys, and their integer values as the values. Your goal is to implement a function `get_logging_level_value(mapping, level)` that takes in a logging level and returns its corresponding integer value based on the provided mapping. If the provided logging level is not found in the mapping, the function should return -1.<|im_end|>

We are given a dictionary `mapping` that maps logging levels (strings) to integers.
 The function `get_logging_level_value(mapping, level)` should:
   - Return the integer value for the given `level` if it exists in the mapping.
   - Return -1 if the `level` is not found.

 Steps:
   1. Check if the `level` is a key in the `mapping` dictionary.
   2. If it is, return the corresponding value.
   3. Otherwise, return -1.

 Example:
   mapping = {'INFO': 1, 'DEBUG': 2, 'ERROR': 3, 'WARN': 4}
   get_logging_level_value(mapping, 'INFO') -> 1
   get_logging_level_value(mapping, 'FATAL') -> -1

 Let's write the function accordingly.

To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that maps a given logging level (as a string) to its corresponding integer value based on a provided dictionary. If the logging level is not found in the dictionary, the function should return -1.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking if a specific logging level (e.g., 'INFO', 'DEBUG') exists in a given dictionary. The dictionary keys are the logging levels, and the values are their respective integer representations.
2. **Key Insight**: The solution requires a straightforward lookup in the dictionary. If the key (logging level) is present, return its corresponding value; otherwise, return -1.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves a simple dictionary lookup. This operation is efficient with an average time complexity of O(1) for hash-based dictionaries like Python's `dict`.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_logging_level_value(mapping, level):
    return mapping.get(level, -1)
```

### Explanation
- **Dictionary Lookup**: The function uses the `get` method of the dictionary. This method retrieves the value for a specified key. If the key is not found, it returns a default value (here, -1).
- **Efficiency**: The `get` method efficiently handles the lookup in constant time, O(1), making the solution optimal for this problem.
- **Edge Handling**: If the provided `level` is not a key in the `mapping` dictionary, the function defaults to returning -1, as specified.

This approach ensures that the solution is both concise and efficient, meeting all the problem requirements with minimal code.<|im_end|>
