You are to implement a simple key-value store in Python that interacts via standard input and output. The key-value store should support the following commands, one per line:

- SET key value: Sets the value for the given key.
- GET key: Retrieves and prints the value associated with the key, or prints None if the key does not exist.
- DELETE key: Deletes the key from the store if it exists.
- SAVE filename: Saves the current key-value store to a given filename in JSON format.
- LOAD filename: Loads the key-value store from a given filename (overwriting the current store). If the file does not exist, clears the store.
- EXIT: Terminates the program.

Input:
Lines of commands described above.

Output:
For GET, output the value or None. For other commands, output nothing.

Example Input:
SET name Alice
GET name
DELETE name
GET name
EXIT

Example Output:
Alice
None<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

 Let me see the example: "SET name Alice" -> so value is "Alice", which is one token.

 However, the problem does not specify that the value is a single token. But the{{{picked token: ' problem' | entropy: 0.6207 | entropy@temp: 1.4930 | delta: 0.8723 | temp: 1.4375}}} problem says: "key value" (with a space) so it's two tokens.

 But what if the value has space? The problem does not specify. We have to design for the requirement.

 Since the problem says: "one per line", and the example uses single words, and the{{{picked token: ' problem' | entropy: 0.1136 | entropy@temp: 0.9033 | delta: 0.7897 | temp: 1.5156}}} problem is simple, we assume that the value is a single{{{picked token: ' token' | entropy: 0.8740 | entropy@temp: 0.0916 | delta: 0.7824 | temp: 0.1885}}} token (without spaces).

 However, to be safe, the problem statement says: "key value" (meaning the value is a single string that we get as the next non-command part). 
...
 But the problem does not specify that the value cannot have spaces. So we have to be cautious.

 Let's look at the{{{picked token: ' problem' | entropy: 0.3809 | entropy@temp: 1.2145 | delta: 0.8336 | temp: 1.3906}}} problem again: "The key-value store should support the following commands, one per line"

 And the example input: 
...
        parts = line.split(maxsplit=1)   # split into at most two parts: [cmd, rest]
        if parts[0] == 'SET':
            key = parts[1].split()[0]  {{{picked token: ' #' | entropy: 1.0028 | entropy@temp: 0.0975 | delta: 0.9054 | temp: 0.2520}}} # but wait, what if the value has space? 

 Alternatively, we can do:
...
 However, the problem says: "key value" (meaning two tokens: key and value) but the value might be multiple tokens? 

 Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe for the{{{picked token: ' problem' | entropy: 2.1460 | entropy@temp: 3.0327 | delta: 0.8867 | temp: 1.3672}}} problem's simplicity (as it's a simple exercise), I'll assume that the value is a single token (without spaces). 

 But the problem says: "the value" (so it's a string that we store). And the example input uses single words.

 Let me see the problem statement: it says "{{{picked token: 'key' | entropy: 1.6754 | entropy@temp: 0.7340 | delta: 0.9414 | temp: 0.5039}}}key value" (with a space) but it doesn't say the value is a single word. However, the{{{picked token: ' problem' | entropy: 0.8807 | entropy@temp: 1.8346 | delta: 0.9539 | temp: 1.4297}}} problem is from a context that expects single words.

 Since the problem says: "For GET, output the value or None", and the value we store is a string, we can store the entire string that comes after the key (without the command).

 Plan:
   We'll split the{{{picked token: ' line' | entropy: 0.8028 | entropy@temp: 0.0005 | delta: 0.8023 | temp: 0.1514}}} line and take the first token as the command.

   For SET:
...

          Example: 
{{{picked token: '           ' | entropy: 1.0943 | entropy@temp: 0.0000 | delta: 1.0943 | temp: 0.0101}}}            line = "SET name Alice" -> tokens = ['SET', 'name Alice'] 
            Then we can do: 
                key = tokens[1].split()[0]   -> but that's not what we want.
...
          I think the problem expects the value to be a single token? But the problem says "value" (so it's a string). 

          Given the problem's simplicity,{{{picked token: ' and' | entropy: 1.0090 | entropy@temp: 0.1885 | delta: 0.8205 | temp: 0.3066}}} and the example, we'll assume the value is a single token (without spaces). 

          But to be safe for the problem (and since the problem says "key value", meaning two tokens), we'll do:
...

          But the problem does not specify that the value is non-empty. So we can have:
{{{picked token: '               ' | entropy: 1.1778 | entropy@temp: 0.3238 | delta: 0.8539 | temp: 0.1699}}}                SET key   -> this would be invalid? 

          The problem says: "{{{picked token: 'one' | entropy: 1.1038 | entropy@temp: 0.2534 | delta: 0.8504 | temp: 0.5430}}}one per line" of the commands. So we assume the input is well-formed.

          Since the problem is simple, we'll assume:
...
            if cmd == 'SET':
                if len(tokens) < 3:
                    # skip? or error? but problem says valid input{{{picked token: ',' | entropy: 1.1966 | entropy@temp: 0.4182 | delta: 0.7784 | temp: 0.4844}}}, so we assume at least 3 tokens{{{picked token: '.\n' | entropy: 0.8873 | entropy@temp: 0.0112 | delta: 0.8761 | temp: 0.2812}}}.
                    pass
                key = tokens[1]
...

            if cmd == 'SET':
                if len(tokens){{{picked token: ' <' | entropy: 0.8389 | entropy@temp: 0.0001 | delta: 0.8388 | temp: 0.1055}}} < 3:
                    continue
                key = tokens[1]
...
        Line1: "SET name Alice" -> tokens = ['SET','name','Alice'] -> store['name'] = 'Alice'
        Line2: "GET name" -> tokens = ['GET','name'] -> print('Alice')
        Line3: "DELETE name" -> tokens = ['DELETE','name'] ->{{{picked token: ' delete' | entropy: 0.8031 | entropy@temp: 0.0060 | delta: 0.7972 | temp: 0.2559}}} delete 'name' from store
        Line4: "GET name" -> tokens = ['GET','name'] -> print(None)
        Line5: "EXIT" -> break.
...
   So that matches.

   We{{{picked token: '\'ll' | entropy: 1.3954 | entropy@temp: 0.5961 | delta: 0.7994 | temp: 0.6250}}}'ll write the code accordingly.

 Important: We must import json.
...
   We'll do as above.

 Let's run the example with a LOAD and SAVE to{{{picked token: ' see' | entropy: 0.8767 | entropy@temp: 0.0874 | delta: 0.7892 | temp: 0.3945}}} see if it works.

   But the problem doesn't require that.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `store` dictionary is initialized to{{{picked token: ' hold' | entropy: 1.2270 | entropy@temp: 0.2884 | delta: 0.9386 | temp: 0.2734}}} hold key-value pairs.
2. **Reading Input**: The program reads each line of input, strips any extraneous whitespace, and skips empty lines.
3. **Token Processing**: Each line is split into tokens to identify the command and its arguments.
