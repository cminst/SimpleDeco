You are to implement a simple key-value store in Python that interacts via standard input and output. The key-value store should support the following commands, one per line:

- SET key value: Sets the value for the given key.
- GET key: Retrieves and prints the value associated with the key, or prints None if the key does not exist.
- DELETE key: Deletes the key from the store if it exists.
- SAVE filename: Saves the current key-value store to a given filename in JSON format.
- LOAD filename: Loads the key-value store from a given filename (overwriting the current store). If the file does not exist, clears the store.
- EXIT: Terminates the program.

Input:
Lines of commands described above.

Output:
For GET, output the value or None. For other commands, output nothing.

Example Input:
SET name Alice
GET name
DELETE name
GET name
EXIT

Example Output:
Alice
None<|im_end|>

                    #   try to load, if it fails (file not found) then clear the store. Otherwise, if it loads, then we overwrite.
                    #{{{picked token: ' We' | entropy: 1.2991 | entropy@temp: 0.4313 | delta: 0.8678 | temp: 0.3496}}} We did that above? Actually, we did:
                    #   try: ... 
...
                    #       store = {}   # clear the store
                   {{{picked token: ' #' | entropy: 0.9580 | entropy@temp: 0.0000 | delta: 0.9580 | temp: 0.0309}}} # But note: the problem says "clears the store" meaning set to empty. So we do that.

{{{picked token: '                   ' | entropy: 1.0835 | entropy@temp: 0.0000 | delta: 1.0835 | temp: 0.0233}}}                    # However, we already did the try-except above? Actually, in the code above we did:
                    #   try: ... 
...

{{{picked token: '       ' | entropy: 0.9990 | entropy@temp: 0.0680 | delta: 0.9309 | temp: 0.1436}}}        elif cmd == "EXIT":
            break
...

 However, we have to be cautious: the input might have{{{picked token: ' multiple' | entropy: 0.9099 | entropy@temp: 1.8456 | delta: 0.9356 | temp: 1.3594}}} multiple lines.

...

{{{picked token: '       ' | entropy: 1.0840 | entropy@temp: 0.0793 | delta: 1.0047 | temp: 0.1201}}}        Input:
          SET name Alice
...

 However, note: the problem says "For other commands, output nothing". So we don't output anything for SET, DELETE, SAVE, LOAD,{{{picked token: ' and' | entropy: 1.0354 | entropy@temp: 0.2030 | delta: 0.8324 | temp: 0.2988}}} and EXIT.

 One more note: the problem says "{{{picked token: 'SAVE' | entropy: 1.2193 | entropy@temp: 0.1979 | delta: 1.0214 | temp: 0.4727}}}SAVE filename" saves in JSON format. We use json.dump which by default uses pretty printing? 
 But the problem doesn't specify the JSON format (it says "JSON format"). The standard is to use the minimal representation? 
...
                    # We'll assume the file can be written. If not, we ignore? 
                    # However, the problem doesn't specify error handling. We'll do nothing on error ({{{picked token: 'so' | entropy: 1.0687 | entropy@temp: 0.0886 | delta: 0.9801 | temp: 0.5117}}}so the command is executed but if there's an error we don't output anything).
                    pass
...

 But note: the problem says "simple". We{{{picked token: '\'ll' | entropy: 1.1798 | entropy@temp: 0.3166 | delta: 0.8632 | temp: 0.4375}}}'ll write the code as above.

...

 We{{{picked token: '\'ll' | entropy: 1.0394 | entropy@temp: 0.0663 | delta: 0.9731 | temp: 0.1992}}}'ll write the code accordingly.

...

 We'll do{{{picked token: ' as' | entropy: 1.6791 | entropy@temp: 0.5347 | delta: 1.1444 | temp: 0.4570}}} as above.
